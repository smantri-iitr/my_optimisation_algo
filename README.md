# my_optimisation_algo

LOGIC:
Its a modified version of gradient descent.
Idea is using simple learning_rate as a step as long as function is getting minimised. Pain arise when
point reaches increasing side of the curve, i.e, function start to increase -> Now use gradient descent 
to find optimal values

NEED:
plane surface -> gradient descent fails -> takes very small steps
